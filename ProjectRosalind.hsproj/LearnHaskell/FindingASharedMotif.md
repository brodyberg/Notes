# Problem

A common substring of a collection of strings is a substring of every member of the collection. We say that a common substring is a longest common substring if there does not exist a longer common substring. For example, `CG` is a common substring of `ACGTACGT` and `AACCGTATA`, but it is not as long as possible; in this case, `CGTA` is a longest common substring of `ACGTACGT` and `AACCGTATA`.

### Note:

The longest common substring is not necessarily unique; for a simple example, `AA` and `CC` are both longest common substrings of `AACC` and `CCAA`.

### Given: 

A collection of `k (kâ‰¤100)` DNA strings of length at most 1 kbp each in FASTA format.

### Return: 

A longest common substring of the collection. (If multiple solutions exist, you may return any single solution.)
