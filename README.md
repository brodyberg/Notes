# Notes

Me learning Haskell. The model here is "progress every day." 

## Content

What you see here is me going through [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/). You can find work from Chapter 5 
and Chapter 16 so far. 

## Credits

100% of this code is from Real World Haskell (with modifications like 
making some functions match on postfix data constructors rather than infix
and exposing some things from PrettyJSON to main.hs in the Haskell for Mac 
version). 

## [Haskell for Mac](http://haskellformac.com/)

To see Chapter 5 in Haskell for Mac, open up PrettyJSON.hsproj in Haskell for Mac. 
This will open up a set of files including main.hs which will be running a simple 
JSON renderer that you can see in the Console output for Haskell for Mac. 

## [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

To see Chater 5 in VS Code, open VS Code and run ctrl-k-o to open the csv/csv1/src 
folder. I can't remember which Haskell integration I installed, but after you install 
one of them (Haskelly or Haskero) you can to ctrl-shift-p and execute Stack:GHCI 
when you have the PrettyJSON.hs file open. Neat. 

ps. Those are Windows keyboard shortcuts
