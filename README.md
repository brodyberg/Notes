# Notes

Me learning Haskell. The model here is "progress every day." 

## Content

The HaskellBook folder is me going through the [Haskell Book](http://haskellbook.com/)

Other stuff is from [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/), 
but is also from before I realized I needed to step back from that and learn
the fundamentals of Haskell from the ground up, from a "can actually do things" 
perspective rather than the "I read [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)"
and think I know things perspective.
