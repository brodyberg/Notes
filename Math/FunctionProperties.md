# Properties of Functions

If we are going to work with functions, we have to create a language for that work. Languages include the ability to compare or distinguish items and functions are no different. Without the ability to compare things we'd be left with a group of undifferentiable things. Instead, it's possible to use the properties below to distinguish or group functions so that we can discuss them individually or in groups in a more useful or precise manner. 

Beyond these properties, the lesson is two-fold: that there are important *physical analogies* we can apply to functions with some of the properties below, and second, that other types of translations between sets, groups, rings etc also have properties themselves and just like we did here we can examine those to improve our precision when discussing or grouping those translations. By learning about function properties, where functions are a slightly more familiar thing, we can later apply that same type of investigation later to less familiar items like rings, groups etc. 

## Context

For the below, the function ```f``` we are talking about is from the set ```A``` to the set ```B```, typically written: 

    f: A -> B

## Definitions

* Domain: items ```f``` pulls from ```A```
* Co-domain: items ```f``` places in ```B```
* Target: see co-domain
* Image: 
* ```Id```<sub>```A```</sub>: "The identity map of ```A```"

# Pro-tip on 'types': 

All functions here are 'typed.' This means that any function you see, say ```f``` or ```Id```<sub>```A```</sub> has an input type and an output type. Those input and output types for any particular function could be different. However, whatever types they are will be be compatible with the type involved in any definition with which they are involved. 

Example: the left and right inverse definitions below involve two items being equated across an ```=``` sign: 

```g``` ∘ ```f``` =  ```Id```<sub>```A```

The quantity on the left of the equal sign is: 

```g``` ∘ ```f```

The type of that quantity is: ```function```

The quantity on the right of the equal sign is: 

```Id```<sub>```A```

The type of that quantity is: ```function```

It would not be correct to equate two things of different types, and we see this definition follows that rule. 

## Injective

<u>Def:</u> A function is injective

## Surjective

## Bijective

## Left-Inverse

## Right-Inverse
