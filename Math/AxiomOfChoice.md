# Axiom of Choice

["Probably the most interesting and, in spite of its late appearance, the most discussed axiom of mathematics, second only to Euclid’s axiom of parallels which was introduced more than two thousand years ago"](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/axiom-choice/) - Stanford Math

["The last great controversy of mathematics"](https://math.vanderbilt.edu/schectex/ccc/choice.html) - Math Vanderbilt

# Formulations

["The claim that, given any collection of mutually disjoint nonempty sets, it is possible to assemble a new set—a transversal or choice set—containing exactly one element from each member of the given collection."](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/axiom-choice/) - Stanford


["Given any set of mutually disjoint nonempty sets, there exists at least one set that contains exactly one element in common with each of the nonempty sets"](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AxiomofChoice.html) - Wolfram

Here is a formal statement of AC. Suppose we have a set W and a rule associating a nonempty set S<sub>w</sub> to each w ∈ W. Then ```AC``` says that there is a function

    f: W →  ⋃  Sw
           w∈W 

such that for all w∈W

    f(w) ∈ Sw
